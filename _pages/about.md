Hi there! My name is Sneha and I am  a recent Master's graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am interested in machine learning how language and vision can be modelled together to create systems which can interact with humans ubiqutuously. 

Previously in what seems another lifetime ago, I was a Data Engineer at [Belong](https://belong.co), in Bangalore India. As the name suggests, the mission was to make people belong at their workplace, using data of course.
